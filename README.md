Developed a Sorting Algorithms Visualization project on GitHub, leveraging Python libraries such as Pygame, Random, and Math.
Proficiently implemented sorting algorithms like bubble sort and insertion sort, showcasing a deep understanding of algorithmic principles.
The project features an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with sorting animations, reset data, and choose between ascending or descending order. 
Notably, the GUI enhances user engagement by providing a visual representation of sorting processes.
Additionally, integrated advanced functionalities for random data generation, offering users the ability to visualize diverse sorting scenarios and contributing to the project's versatility.
